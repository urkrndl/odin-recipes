This project is to design a website about recipes. I'm expecting this to look super amateur and just be a white screen with some text on it, maybe a photo or two. But the important thing I'm learning here is to build the bare bones of a website without being hand-held through the process. I expect it to go reasonably well; my only concern being navigating Git and leave well written notes in my commits.
