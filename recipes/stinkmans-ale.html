    <h1>Stinkman's Ale</h1>
<img src="../images/ale.jpg" alt="A disgusting, smelly beer">
    <p><strong>Stinkman's ale</strong> is a personal favourite of mine. All you really need is any old beer and a stinky old homeless man
        to get started! Follow along and have your very own <strong>stinkman's ale</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A large pint of your favourite <em>ale</em></li>
        <li>Two of the dirtiest <em>nickles</em> you can find</li>
        <li>One <em>sock of a homeless man</em> (Two for added funk)</li>
    </ul>
<p>Enjoy! But don't drink too many of these. You'll be drunk as a skunk and your wife won't want to kiss your diaper mouth.</p>
