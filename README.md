This project is to design a website about recipes. I'm expecting this to look super amateur and just be a white screen with some text on it, maybe a photo or two. But the important thing I'm learning here is to build the bare bones of a website without being hand-held through the process. I expect it to go reasonably well; my only concern being navigating git and leave well written notes in my commits.

Update: This project is completed. I did not follow the instructions entirely because I felt it was unnecessary to add so much extra text to a practice website. All in all, this project really helped me figure out how to use git properly. The HTML commands weren't too hard to remember, and I got better at creating links to other folders and files within the project. I even decided to copy and paste everything that was on the first recipe page so I could quickly fill in the details of the other recipes. I feel confident in moving on from HTML at this point.
